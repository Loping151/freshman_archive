use battleground.py to battle, support game mode and compare mode.

agents should not include subfiles

should import agent.submission first.

In judgement.py are tool functions used for battle.

playground are for test and play with classmates(maybe on 7.1), useless now

About the agents:

Random is the given agent from the Jidi platfrom.

Lo_Gobang_151 is the initial version in the report, finished on 6.30.

Lo_Gobang_151_v2 updated score method.

Lo_Gobang_151_v3 updated double mode.

Lo_Gobang_151_v4 updated score method. 4_5 alse updated score method.

Lo_Gobang_151_v4 is 151v2 in the report.

Lo_Gobang_151_another is the version from v3, modified by teammates.

Lo_Gobang_Coach is randomly choose from the first two, and is now useless. Later I used v4 as coach.

Lo_Gobang_alpha is the search method, initially without function update_op. update_op is only an option.

Lo_Gobang_Zero_torch was lost, reconstructed in pycharm, so I have no way to recover them, pity. Anyway, some models
remained.

Lo_Gobang_Zero is realized with tf2. agent act with a trained Lo_DQN
